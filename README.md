# Dot Fall
Simple game written using Phaser 3 and Typescript.
Main aim is to fall with the ball as long as you can.

To build the game, run `npm install` in project root and then `gulp`. Then open created `dist/index.html`.
Build process is poorly configured, so after adding new file to `src` your need to restart gulp.
